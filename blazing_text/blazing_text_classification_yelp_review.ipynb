      "\"My favorite brunch place in the Soho area. Small locale so get there early and enjoy a nice cup of coffee while you wait. Their coffee is delicious, as well as the hot and toasty French bread which is honestly my favorite part of the dining experience. For main dishes, I recommend the Tuna Tartar, French Toast, Pancakes, and Creme Souffle dishes. Absolutely wonderful staff. Ã‚Â The chef was a little late in the morning, so they gave us free mimosas to pass the time. Definitely worth the price!\",0\n",
      "\"The best southern food in NYC, hands down. I always get the Reggie Harris. Ã‚Â It is crispy honey glazed chicken which reminds me of Korean fried style chicken but in a southern format. WUT!? YES. The mac-n-cheese is wonderful and so are the greens. Eat up!\",0\n",
      "\"After seeing all the great reviews about this place, I really have to say I kind of expected more. The setting is very low-key (that's an understatement), and I'd even say divey in nature. Then I thought, maybe this means the food will be that much better and more authentic (after all, sometimes the best places are those that focus more on the food and less on decor). Ã‚Â I got the beef noodle soup, and while it was generally satisfying and tasty, it was by no means anything to write home about. Ã‚Â I've heard that lamb noodle soup in flushing is better, and I've certainly had better ramen in the city. I realize these are totally different cuisines, but I'm speaking generally in terms of noodle soups. The noodles were very good, and tasted extremely fresh, as were the green vegetables in the soup. There was a consistency to the noodles which was truly different and more interesting than your typical chinese noodle soup dish. However, the broth itself was really uneventful, tasting watery and lacking any real flavor. The beef also was a bit tough and unimpressive. However, if you are in the mood for a hot, bowl of soup, with some good noodles, a bowl of noodles here will definitely satisfy that craving and its definitely worth a try if you haven't been. And the prices can't be beat. Honestly, 5-7 dollars for a huge meal is pretty good in my opinion.\",0\n",
      "\"If you go, sit in the back garden. It feels like you smoked something and now all the lanterns around you have supersized. First time I had pizza at a restaurant and I wasn't disappointed. It was a bit noisy but that's a sign that there a lot of people having a good time. I'm hoping to go again and try some of their traditional Italian entrees. Eat here and take a stroll through Washington Square Park.\",0\n",
      "\"Quite possibly one of my newest favorite place. We got there at 10:30 which is close to when they shut down for the night and our waitress (in the front bar room) couldn't have been nicer. PERFECTLY prepared shellfish, clams, lobster, with blue gloves to keep you clean!! First time I left a seafood joint not stinking like Fulton fish market! Will definitely be back. Staff couldn't have been nicer!\",0\n",
      "West Village always seems to have the best brunch places. This is a great place with a rustic sort of vibe. It's quite small so come early! Their brunch menu is amazing..it ranges from salads to crispy fried chix sandwiches. I got the avocado toast- it came with a multigrain toast and eggs with salad. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a lighter brunch option. All their ingredience are very fresh and tasty! I will defintely come here again!,0\n",
      "\"During my 4 day stay in New York, Mamoun's was the only place my friend and I went to twice! It was conveniently located a couple blocks away from where we were staying, and located close enough to walk to from all the bars in the area. It's a tiny little place to get a falafel sandwich for $2.50. Quick and yummy, there's nothing to complain about. By the way, don't be fooled by those bottles of red sauce on the tables! I drizzled some onto my falafel sandwich and it thoroughly set my mouth on fire.\",0\n",
      "\"How this place has less than 4 stars is beyond me. Ã‚Â Just went to brunch here on a beautiful day and sat outside in their awesome garden. Ã‚Â Waited a bit for a table, but the wait was worth sitting outside for! Ã‚Â Now for the food. Ã‚Â Oh mama. Ã‚Â This was some of the best brunch food I've had in the city. Ã‚Â We ordered the salmon benedict, duck hash confit, and the pancake with mac n cheese and lamb sausage as our free check in sides. Ã‚Â Everything was incredible, but the stars were the duck and the pancake, with the latter of the two being my recommendation if you had to choose one thing. Ã‚Â Ask for Ivy if you can! Ã‚Â She was an awesome server. Ã‚Â Very quick and helpful when it came to making some tough menu decisions. Ã‚Â I will definitely be back!!\",0\n",
      "\"Come here geared up with patience and half an appetite. Ã‚Â Tartine is one of those high commodity brunch places where no matter when, there will be a wait during the weekend. Ã‚Â We waited approximately 40 minutes in the chilly early spring weather for a seat of 3. Ã‚Â Tartine is obnoxiously tiny, if you move an inch you will be on a stranger. Ã‚Â  The service is fast, quick and rushed. Ã‚Â As soon as we sat, there already was water glasses filled and waiter hovering over our heads to decide on the food. Ã‚Â I ended up getting the House Gravlax Plate which was pretty much sliced smoked salmon with stale bread and burnt roasted potatoes; sounded intriguing in my 2 seconds I had to look at the menu. Ã‚Â All the dishes (gravlax, benedict and croquette) were fairly small. Ã‚Â The small dishes actually came into our favor since we wanted to grab dessert afterwards. Ã‚Â Caution! Do not order gravlax! Ã‚Â Even if brunch is on the cheaper end, it's not worth it. Tartine's brunches are all $15 for entree and OJ and coffee and tea are included. Ã‚Â Also, it's cash only! Ã‚Â There are plenty of wait worthy brunches in the city / west village, don't waste your time here waiting, being cramped in, and rushed out.\",0\n",
      "\"First time in this location - I've only ever gone to the one near Astor place. I'm deducting a star because the price keeps climbing up ($3 now). But the falafel is still delicious, the veggies fresh, and the hot sauce deadly. A little hole in the wall - pick up your food and go eat it at Washington Square Park!\",0\n"
